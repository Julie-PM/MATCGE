# MATCGE
MAT CGE is a stylized material flow consistent computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that includes Circular Economy features to understand CE effects on resources consumption and climate change (i.e., CO_2 emissions). The model is being developped by the <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/tsc/about">Tilburg Sustainability Center (TSC)</a>  at the University of Tilburg part of the <a href="https://circomod.eu/">Circomod project</a>.


The model is written in Python. The code is provided in Jupiter. 

# How to use
*Preliminary version Not finsihed - for more information please check <a href="https://wiki.circomod.eu/MATCGE">the dedicated Wiki page</a>*.

The code needs an excel or .csv file which contain at least 5 tabs:
- SAM
- PIOT1
- PIOT2
- TAX
- MATERIALS
