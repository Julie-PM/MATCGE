# MATCGE
A stylized material flow consistent computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that includes Circular Economy features - developed by the University of Tilburg.
The model is written in Python. The code is provided in Jupiter. 

# How to use
*Preliminary version Not finsihed - for more information please check <a href="https://wiki.circomod.eu/MATCGE">the dedicated Wiki page</a>*
The code needs an excel or .csv file which contain at least 5 tabs:
- SAM
- PIOT1
- PIOT2
- TAX
- MATERIALS
